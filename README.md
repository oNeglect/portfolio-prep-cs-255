# **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

# **Summary**
The DriverPass project consisted of various aspects including detailing business requirements and system requirements for the client and representing those requirements consistently and efficiently.

# **Client**
We worked with a client named DriverPass, who strived to achieve a decrease in the failure rate in the number of students who applied for the driving license exam because they found many of the students only had access to the previous test. The client found this to be preposterous, therefore, teaming up with our small consulting company to determine what kind of system would be conducive to higher-achieving students and an increase in their success rate.

# **Type Of System**
The type of system DriverPass wanted us to design consisted of various aspects and ideas. One main component of the system needed customers to be able to take online classes and practice tests wherever they were. Understanding this, building a cloud-based infrastructure robustly and effectively would help to solidify their requirements. The client/stakeholders also wanted data to be online from any computer or mobile device, which would help facilitate online/offline access to reports and information that could be used in connections with Word, Excel, etc. Lastly, security measures for accounts, database structured principles, and infrastructure functionality were taken into account for the type of system that would be appropriate for the design.

# **What did you do particularly well?**
I believe I performed best on the analytical side of the project, obtaining the necessary information to suggest implementations that would further prove an effective and robust system. I also feel I did extremely well on the construction of the diagrams (with the help of many people, videos, and resources) which helped to enlighten and strengthen my understanding of various concepts and ideas. Overall, I am truly grateful for the help from everyone on my journey!

# **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would choose to revise the UML Use Case Diagram. The ways I would improve it are by increasing the number of use cases, actors, and various relationships within the system to further encompass the processes. I was only able to utilize the free software, which only allowed for a certain number of objects/symbols.

# **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

# **Interpretation Of User Needs**
I was able to interpret the user's needs and implement them into my system design in various ways. One was by dissecting the transcript and compartmentalizing the entire project. After I was able to do so, implementation was straightforward. Researching what systems would help the client/stakeholder achieve their goal (utilizing cloud infrastructure, understanding concepts of hardware/software, etc.) helped to solidify the end goal in a more coherent and precise form.

# **The Importance Of User's Needs When Designing**
It is very important to understand and properly implement users’ needs when designing software or a system for many reasons. One reason would cost. If you are expending time/cost on a project, only to receive a product at the end which isn't aligned with the client/stakeholder, resources will have been wasted. That is one very important aspect to understand that can help with consistent and efficient design qualities for any individual to some extent. Another important notion for understanding the client's need is client perpetuation. What I mean by this is by having a positive rapport with a client, your company may encounter more projects from that client. That would mean a more efficient a lucrative environment for your team and many others involved.

# **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

# **Approach To Designing Software**
My approach to designing software is quite simple. I understand that a clear mind goes a long way first and foremost. Understanding the client's needs, and fully having a grasp on how to implement the system is another great quality to have. Time management and breaking down the requirements in a language that makes sense to you, and is practical to the constraints of the design also help to solidify concepts and ideas to come to fruition.

# **Techniques Or Strategies For Future Use**
The techniques or strategies I would use for future use in conducting high-quality system design would be what I learned most in this course. Patience and time management when it comes to designing, understanding clients’ needs, and meditation/reflection. Taking delicate time to truly understand the client/stakeholder and implementing ethical and clear system design procedures are the techniques and strategies I will use in the future. That way, my design process can be utilized in a way that takes into account multiple perspectives and can be flexible at any time to some extent.
